# Welcome to Comprehensive Rust ðŸ¦€ Two-Day

This is a fork of the free Rust course developed by the Android team at Google. The course covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced topics like generics and error handling.  This experimental fork is intended to be taught in just two days. As such, it omits some material and zooms over other.

> The latest version of the course can be found at
> <https://rust-edu.github.io/comprehensive-rust-2day/>. If you are reading
> somewhere else, please check there for updates.

The goal of the course is to teach you Rust. We assume you don't know anything
about Rust and hope to:

* Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
* Enable you to modify existing programs and write new programs in Rust.
* Show you common Rust idioms.

## Non-Goals

Rust is a large language and we won't be able to cover all of it in a few days.
Some non-goals of this course are:

* Learning how to develop macros: please see [Chapter 19.5 in the Rust
  Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html) and [Rust by
  Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/macros.html) instead.

* Covering specialized topics: the full version of Comprehensive Rust includes
  "deep dives" on several topics.

## Assumptions

The course assumes that you already know how to program. Rust is a statically-typed language and we will sometimes make comparisons with C and C++ to better explain or contrast the Rust approach.

If you know how to program in a dynamically-typed language such as Python or
JavaScript, then you will be able to follow along just fine too.

This two-day version also assumes that you have set up a working Rust development environment and familiarized yourself with the basics of Rust before starting. This includes reviewing the first few chapters of [*The Rust Programming Language*]() in advance. We will review this material, but rather quickly.

This is an example of a _speaker note_. We will use these to add additional
information to the slides. This could be key points which the instructor should
cover as well as answers to typical questions which come up in class.
